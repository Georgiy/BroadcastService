# BroadcastService
Test project for Metricell

Task:

Develop sample application that uses the TelephonyManager APIs to monitor cell location/signal strength and service state of the handset and display these in a simple UI activity.

 

Description:

The application should display the current cell location/signal strength and service state, and update the UI when the values change. The demo application should be compatible with Android 5.0 and above.

 

Optional (but desirable):

The monitoring of cell location/signal strength/service state could be monitored continuously in a background service when the UI is not in the foreground. The UI activity may then bind to the background service to retrieve the latest values and use broadcasts to receive updates of value changes. The background monitoring to continuosly save the measurements in a log file.
